                    <p><a class="in-text" href="https://inanimatealice.com/">Inanimate Alice</a> is an interactive visual novel created by the BradField Company.  It tells the story of a young girl growing up and dreaming of one day becoming a game designer.  The project was a collaboration between the CDM and the BradField Company to create and design a game prototype, continuing the series. I worked with a group of six master students from the Centre of Digital Media.
                    We were tasked with creating an interactive game prototype for industry client BradField Company Production that effectively and seamlessly integrated into the Inanimate Alice series.</p>

                    <p>Due to the time and nature of the problem we had to work closely as group to find a way to engage users while still keeping true to past work.  We tried to keep a clear focus on staying true to Aliceâ€™s voice and the dystopian feel of the past novels.</p>
                    <p>We created a brand new story that begins from where Alice leaves off in the last novel (episode 6).  Using a branching narrative that folds back into the main storyline and immersive interactive 360 scenes, we created the next step for Alice.</p>

                    <p> I took on the role of the programmer on the team.  Initially the whole team begun by brainstorming possible story points.  We knew there were some key elements that would need to be included in the story, such as where the story begun and characters that would be prevalent.  We incorporated key themes and as a group decided on one cohesive storyline.  After this we discussed the best way to showcase our story, keeping in mind the month and a half deadline we had.  We then split into our respective roles.  Knowing that I would be utilizing Unity, I researched the best way to create the 360 experience and the branching narrative.  I compiled all art assets given to me by the team members into one web-based game.</p>
                    <p>Since our project ran only for a little over a month, we had to keep our expectations in check.  We needed to think about what sort of ideas would be feasible and what we could accomplish.  Working with a new team can also be a challenge, it was the first time I was involved in an agile environment, working with scrums and daily stand-ups.</p>
